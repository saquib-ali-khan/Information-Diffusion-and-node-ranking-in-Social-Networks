# node-importance-in-networks
This is My implementation in python for the following research paper as a part of one of the research works under my lab supervisor as follows:
"Evaluating the importance of nodes in complex networks:
Jun Liu a , Qingyu Xiong b,c,∗ , Weiren Shi a , Xin Shi a , Kai Wang a"
## I have used Networkx library of python as underlying tool.
## I ran it on US-airport dataset
But it can be easily run on other datasets as well by just changing the path variable to a file path having the dataset, (wherein the first column is a node, and then a space column and then the other node".

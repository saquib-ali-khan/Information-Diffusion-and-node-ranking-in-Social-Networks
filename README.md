# Node-Importance-In-Social-Networks
This is my implementations in python for the following research papers as a part of one of the research works under my lab supervisor as follows:
1."A shapley value based approach to discover influential nodes in a network: Ramasuri Narayanam, Yadati Narahari "
    ## underlying tool is python language.
    ## Given a any graph as per input format in the code, output will be vertices in their order of influence.

2."Evaluating the importance of nodes in complex networks:
    Jun Liu a , Qingyu Xiong b,c,∗ , Weiren Shi a , Xin Shi a , Kai Wang a"
    ## I have used Networkx library of python as underlying tool.
    ## I ran it on US-airport dataset
    But it can be easily run on other datasets as well by just changing the path variable to a file path having the dataset, (wherein the 
    first column is a node, and then a space column and then the other node column".
